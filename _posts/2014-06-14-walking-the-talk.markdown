Since I published [Fruits of the Spirit][leanpub] I've been able to walk the talk. I'm no longer focused on writing; I'm focused on Loving every person and situation I come in contact with.

Here's one example.

My son received an iPad for his birthday. The parental controls are not straight forward as I thought. As a result he wound up with $116 of "in-app" purchases on my credit card.

I wasn't upset in the least. I just treated it as a cue to manifest Love. I explained to him that it was partly my fault that he was able to do it. Did he realize what was happening? I didn't because iTunes doesn't send notification nor receipt until a day or two after any transaction.

That's how he was able to buy so many in-app upgrades for a supposedly "free" app.

I asked if he had any money to repay me with, and that's when he got upset. He did, $98.00 in his piggy bank. All of his money from allowances this year was suddenly gone, and his life was over. That's what he said, "My life is over!"

Wow! Who knew, right? Here's what I told him.

"Your life is not over. You've gone completely negative. Let's stop and discuss why. You're having the classic problem that all of humanity has: the tendency to go negative. Why didn't you go positive instead? Wasn't that ever an option?"

"I don't know!" he sobbed angrily.

"I can tell you why and keep in mind that I've gone negative many, many times until I got tired of it. So remember this: being negative and destructive 'my life is over' is the easiest thing in the world to do. It's called `judgment` which I define as `a negative prediction of the future based on the past that has nothing to do with this present moment`."

"In order to go positive you have to let go of the negative, so let's both breathe in deeply and let go of the negative energy as we breathe out."

"Now comes the tricky part of going positive: we never know what shape or form it will manifest as, and we don't know when it will. Nobody does. It requires that we forgive our self, and then be patient and mindful."

"We often are limited in our actions, but we are never limited in our thinking, in believing good, wonderful things are possible no matter how dark our circumstances are."

"How about you and I say a simple prayer that we get double that money back? Let's see what happens because if we stay negative we are guaranteed negative outcomes, right?"

He nodded.

So we said a simple prayer to who knows what. Two days later I received **triple** that money back.
