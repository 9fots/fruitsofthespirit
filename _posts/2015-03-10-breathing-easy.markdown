BREATHING EASY
expanding my awareness
to my infinite memory
perceiving my old triggers
in the last of breathing
		gasping
				for that last suck of air
		so grateful that that's
		all over and done fucking my soul

I'm breathing easy
		now that I let it all go
		to focus on thhis holy moment
			to manifest every single one of my hopes
			manifest only this moment
			Don't let my focus wander to tomorrow
			Stay right here right now
