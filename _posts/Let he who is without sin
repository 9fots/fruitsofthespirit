When jesus tells the wold-be stoners "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." he is referring to the letter of the law. If people would not judge themselves, they would not judge others. They would learn the spirit of the law.

When he turns to the woman and says "Go, and sin no more", he is referring to the spirit of the law. Why this difference: if you follow your heart, you know the right thing to do. It's not a moral issue because there are no restrictions to the spirit of the law, which is Love.

In order to love your neighbor, you must first learn to love your self. How do you do that: start by treating others as you would have them treat you.

The woman was caught red-handed having sex with someone who was not her husband. Contrast that with the trial of Jesus where Pilate says he doesn't understand why Jesus's people think he committed any kind of offense that warrants his death. The Pharisees and Sadducees, for different reasons, agreed that Jesus should be put to death.

The Pharisees did so for political reasons as they were wealthy and wanted to keep Rome happy at all costs. The Sadducees did so because they were interested more in their traditions; it's odd though, because what Jesus said was more in line with their tradition. Ultimately Jesus was a threat to the wealth of the Pharisees, and the control of the common, middle-class Jews exerted by the Sadducees.
