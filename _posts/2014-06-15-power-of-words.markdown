Words arise out of thoughts, which arise out of beliefs. Beliefs are synthetically forged in the mind (doctrine) or organically via your heart.

Whenever you speak from your heart your words do not return to you empty (Isaiah 55:11). When you pray, you will have whatever you believe (Matt. 22:21).

Too often Christians start praying willy nilly for everything they can and are sore when they're prayers are not answered. They begin to doubt themselves, and rationalize away why this could be. They are moral, righteous people who profess loving Jesus openly and publicly. They have started down the path of merit, competitiveness and reward.

Surely the Lord will reward them for their good works.

The upshot: your belief has devolved from believing as a child to rationalizing like a theologian. This thought process is thoroughly institutionalized in the modern conservative movement; these are the roots of `legalism`, the strict adherence to the letter of the law.

The spirit of the law is ignored, marginalized as irrelevant, impertinent, and needless to the concepts of *salvation* which it turns out is nothing more than <a href="http://9fruitsofthespirit.com/mammon-institutionalized.html">serving mammon.</a>

Thus we get words from religious and political authorities that say one thing and mean another. No need to analyze it like I do, you will know them by their fruits. They manifest according to their beliefs regardless of what that belief is and where it resides.

In other words, they do not walk the talk. They do not manifest their promises because they are double-minded. They believe with their mind and publicly speak their words, and guess what &mdash; their words return to them with the fruits of their beliefs.

I tire instantly when I read or hear the words a politician says. Take my childhood friend Miles Dewhirst for example. He's running for office in Colorado. His campaign is based on these 2 phrases:  “How does this make you more free, and how does this empower you?”

It's in the context that government enslaves you, and takes away your freedom. It's neatly designed to appeal to a self-reinforcing belief that government is bad. It's ironic that Miles is a lawyer who makes his living off of the same government he says enslaves and dis-empowers you, and he seeks to work in this same government.

Prediction - Miles will actually find ways to expand his law practice. Good for him, but not good for Coloradans because of this one simple fact: conservatives do not nor ever have walked the talk. We know them by their fruits: socialize the costs, privatize the profits. They earnestly believe that God allows their legalistic schemes to thrive, even bless it just because they go to church and believe that every reward is merit-based.

What's love got to do with it?
