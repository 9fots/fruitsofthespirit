In order for Jesus to throw money changers out of today's church He would have to burn down the temple and level entire cities.

That's part of the reason he preached away from temples, out in the countryside.

Another was to get people out of their comfort zones, as well as away from the religious leaders. He had to have known they would be upset enough to murder him.

Have you done anything worthy to upset the power structure? I have. [Fruits of the Spirit][leanpub]. Contrary to popular "widsom", <em>anyone</em> can manifest fruits of the spirit.
