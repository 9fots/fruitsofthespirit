Beliefs are self-reinforcing. This means that whatever you believe reinforces that belief, blinding you to other perspectives, cementing illusions as gospel. Regardless of your religion, its beliefs reinforce themselves.

Beliefs self-reinforce by projecting onto the world the beliefs' interpretation of the world. All illusions appear to be real because of this reinforcement energy that uses your mind to deceive you into believing that the self-reinforcement is the truth.

If you believe all people are born bad, then you will see the world as evil where bad things happen, and pray to God for the evil to stop.

Beliefs centered in your mind and not based on who you were created to be will corrupt you ten times out ten. Beliefs create a stronghold in your thought pattern so that events as you see them conform to your beliefs.

This is why C.S. Lewis wrote "the elves are for themselves." No matter how hard Lucy tried to convince them that all was alright, they refused to jump out of their self-reinforcing beliefs.

This is why when Jesus healed the blind man there was argument about whether he was actually blind since birth, or not. To which it didn't really matter.

Beliefs are the hardest things to change, partly because of habit, mostly because we remain unaware and incognizant of how beliefs are self-reinforcing. Beliefs instantaneously lodge into our ego and alter our perception of reality to reinforce the belief.

Most of the beliefs that I encounter daily are rooted in law, legalism and morality. [As I've written in my book, `Fruits of the Spirit`][leanpub] sin is **not** law- or morality-based. Sin is not believing who you are born to be. When you act against what your heart knows your Self to be, you are making a mistake whether or not their is a law that condemns it or not.

Moses was a murderer. He fled the scene of his crime. Those 2 acts went against his nature; we find out later he is a Deliverer who talks funny, perhaps with a lisp. He was saved as a baby by floating on a river. His most famous manifestation also involved water.<sup>*</sup>

Ego-mind is extremely slippery. As soon as you grasp certain truths that contradict self-reinforcing beliefs, ego begins evasive dodging, redirects, rationalizations and justifications on behalf your learned beliefs.

Ego cloaks its evasions in its self-reinforcements so that beliefs appear to be truth. Perception is everything. Beliefs reinforce and empower your illusions.

Love however doesn't require belief. Love just is. Love is the quintessential eternal existentialist experience. Where ego needs to justify, Love is everywhere and you would know it if you could just turn off your belief systems for a moment and meditate on Love in order to become aware of your illusions, their self-reinforcing beliefs, and how they blind you.

This is moving into Truth. Love never needs justification. Love is our true nature. Love your Self today, so that we all can manifest the goodness we know in our heart always exists.
