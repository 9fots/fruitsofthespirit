I have a lot to say about [this post][post], not about what you wrote, but what you quote.

First, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, but it's not okay to let mainstream media `inform` you with their pro-violence propaganda because peace does not sell. Solutions do not sell. If it bleeds it leads.

Every single church I belonged to was/is pro-Israel. Every single church I belonged to promoted the concept of a `God out there` and `God's will`. Every single church I belonged to eventually had a Divorce Recovery Workshop. Not a single church I know of has ever had a Love Workshop. Not a single church I know of ever had a Minister, priest, or other authority who didn't have or eventually didn't receive a Masters in Divinity.

Note that there isn't an accredited program offering a Masters in Love; there should be because I cannot think of a single circumstance or situation in Life that Love can't handle.

If you you're going to Master Love, you need to learn how to love your Self. Starting your day out listening to or reading the Propaganda and Hate Channel will not magically awaken your mind to Love. Ever.

And even if you do read/listen to Democracy Now! or read the Intercept, follow Glenn Greenwald, Jeremy Scahill as I do, you'll go mad anyways. There's nothing you can do about other people's shit. Period.

The Church, the News, the constant level of bullshit promulgated in American Culture is a clusterfucking mindfuck and a soulfuck. But only if you let it be. All of that resides in the domain of the Ego-Mind Center of Legalistic Legalism of Just Because. It exists only because you believe it exists. It's a very clever illusion because it is completely self-reinforcing. Just the mere fact that I mention this reinforces it.

On the other hand, Love is not loud and clamorous. Love is not self-seeking. Love doesn't promote itself. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love doesn't watch the news and become overwhelmed. Love is merely appropriate for any circumstance, any situation and all occasions.

All I can do is Love each person that enters my path as my Self. I have to be aware of opportunities to Love them as I Love my Self.
