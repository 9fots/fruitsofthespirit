slug: The reason most don't accept and embrace their Self is because they cannot believe that each of us really are powerful, divine beings. For quite some time now people are waking up to their Divinity which is rooted not in Law, legalism, morality or other social, political constructs, but firmly rooted in the Spirit of the Law - Love.

Beware of the power of belief. Belief is belief. It doesn't matter what it is you believe in, the mere act of believing makes it so.

Beliefs are self-reinforcing. The universe is not mocked: we reap what we sow and we sow by believing. We believe what we are told by "authorities" such as legal authorities, religious authorities, et. al.

Beliefs, sow and reap, are agnostic. It doesn't matter what you believe in. We each reap what we have sown. We believe it, think it, act it, speak it and thereby manifest (reap) it.

This template was communicated in Gen. 3:3  Eve believed she wasn't like God and she ate the apple. Now ask your Self: did YOU eat the apple, too? Jesus came not for the righteous, but the sinners. The sinners are the people who believe in the wrong thing about their Self, which causes them to act against what they know to be true just because something outside of their Self convinced them to.

The 10 Commandments are not the be all end all guiding principles for life on Earth. Laws don't change behaviors. If they did then Jesus never would have said that the sum of all laws and commands was the Love your neighbor as your Self. In order to do that you have to Love your Self, accept, embrace who you know in your heart your Self to be.

The reason most don't accept and embrace their Self is because they cannot believe that each of us really are powerful, divine beings. For quite some time now people are waking up to their Divinity which is rooted not in Law, legalism, morality or other social, political constructs, [but firmly rooted in the Spirit of the Law: Love.][leanpub]

There's no Love in Revelations. Go ahead and believe if it you want. There's no requirement made of you in that horrible book. But I find it absolutely despicable to do as most Christians do: sit back and watch the show as if it were some kind of "reality" TV show that we have no control over.

The second coming of Christ is happening right now. Christ consciousness is happening everywhere and if you're looking to read about it in Mammon News, you're out of luck. And if you're looking for the anti-christ you need to look inside your heart first and ask "Am I following the letter of the Law? Or am I following my heart with Love for my Self and my neighbor?"

This right here and now never was, is, nor will be about right or wrong, morals, laws, nor tradition. It was, is, and always will be about Love.

You serve God? Then Love your neighbor by looking after them. Don't evangelize or try to get them `saved` because the only saving they need is from your incorrect interpretation of `sin` which judges them as candidates for Hell - nevermind the Lord's prayer indicated we are to manifest Heaven right here right now.
