The primary reason I subtitled [Fruits of the Spirit][leanpub] with "Overcoming the Presence of the Past" is because the past is always present.

We are aware of yesterday only because of the Law's daily reminders of it.

We are surrounded, saturated with law-based thought patterns that self-reinforce the past.

However, Love doesn't do that. Love cares only about <strong>*this*</strong> moment. That's because Love is eternal and can exist only in <strong>*this*</strong> moment.

Love forgives and heals all, even that from all of your yesterdays. Thus Love will overcome the presence of the past, making all things new. Believe it.
