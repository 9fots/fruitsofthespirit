Awakening Hearts Do Greater Works. 

You cultivate your heart by sending it thoughts generated by your Spirit. 

Since You are the source of everything you experience, you are foregoing your ego's imprisonment via outward programming. In its place you're pouring the new wine of your Spirit -  you know who your true Self is - into the new wine skin of your heart. 

This is the essential, primary activity of Loving your Self. All outer thoughts/voices interact with their false projections of your false programming. If you're not awakening to your true Self then you are in conflict with yourself and others. 

Thus the only command necessary for salvation from your ego is Love your neighbor as your Self.
