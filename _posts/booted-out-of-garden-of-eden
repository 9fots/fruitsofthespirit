Being booted out of the Garden of Eden is a metaphor. Sin is nothing more than ignoring your heart. Metaphorically, the snake got Eve to believe she was not like God. This became a double-edged template on which all lies and false beliefs are based on.

You are very much like God, Source, Universe. The false belief os separation has all kinds of consequences. Scarcity is the root of those consequences. Fear, murder, lies, etc. are merely the bitter fruits, the manifestations of that false belief.

Beliefs are beliefs. It matters not whether the belief is right or wrong, up or down, or bent sideways in three dimensions. Belief ALWAYS produces fruit. So believing in the wrong things about your Self produces scarcity and its attendant emotional states.

Because beliefs ALWAYS produce fruits, they are ALWAYS self-reinforcing. You believe, you manifest fruits accordingly, you rinse and repeat. Therefore it must be true.

Except it's not; it's just another self-reinforcing belief.

Those who believe in morality believe in the letter of the law. Morality, laws, cannot induce change within and without. Never have, never will.

Those who believe in Love, believe in the Spirit of the Law. There are no laws nor restrictions placed on Love. Love transcends everything. It's eternal and yet exists only in this moment. Thus Love is eternity realized in this moment.
