I struggled with principles of Law of Attraction and The Secret mainly because I always associated believing with being healed of my severe hearing loss.

Also because of my belief system was rooted in Law itself, a stumbling block of huge proportions.

It wasn't until I wrote [Fruits of the Spirit][leanpub] that I was able to just believe in my Self that I was able to rest and trust in Source for everything.

Each day we manifest according to our beliefs, regardless. We're either putting out positive beliefs about our Self or we're resorting to the same old, worn-out belief system that entrapped us.

Believing in the wrong things about your Self reduces to *lack*, a sense of *not good enough* (merit) that are based solely on Law, and not Love.

Believing you are capable, can grow, can improve, and achieve your goals, to step up and be everything in your heart you know your Self to be will manifest according to who you are.

Believing just for its own sake isn't belief - it's delusional wishful thinking, and it's not healthy.

Let's not kid ourselves. Let's accept who we are. Don't judge - accept your Self and be who you know in your heart your Self to be.
