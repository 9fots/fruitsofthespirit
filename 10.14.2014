Honeybee Talk/Honey Tasting
Master beekeeper Tim Brod talk about honeybees and answer any questions you have about bees, beekeeping, and how to make your neighborhood Bee Friendly. Bring your kids and friends for this fun and informative speaker. October 14th, 6:00-7:30pm, at Robert Young's house. 1938 E. Evans Ave., Lakewood  http://highlandbees.com/media.html


True story: I woke with a headache. It got progressively worse. Finally at 3:15 i snipped 2 flowers off my plant. I steeped them in hot water for 5 minutes. Ate the flowers, chased it with the tea. 15 minutes later I forgot that I had been useless all day. Made 3 quick signs and totally spaced the 4pm meeting I was to attend. God I felt so good, and relieved that I wasn't going to die. Cannabis heals.

My favorite long (10k) trailhead repoened last week. Yesterday I got to run it. At 8k there's a round rail fence. I've hopped it many times from one direction, but from the other. I hopped it with both feet on one side - you know that syle, right? - and the rail spun forward, causing my skins to bash into the rail as I flipped over onto the pile rock rocks. It happened so fast that my mind could take only 3 snapshots: the ground about 12 inches from my face. The sky when I somehow landed on my back. And the trail as I shot up and ran. It wasn't adrenaline at all that made me pop up. I instantly felt AOK.

There were 3 people a mere 6 feet away from me. They had to been freaking as I head or heeled the fence. As soon as I landed I said loudly "THAT DID NOT GO OVER WELL!" As soon as I said it I started laughing, popped up and ran away. What can I say: I felt awesome.

http://bit.ly/neonicsinrivers   This is the USGS link that states they found neonics in all 9 rivers

IA,MN,MT,NE,ND,SD,WI have the highest use of neonicotinoid in US. All 9 rivers show neonic use.



BPA is no longer used. So what is used? BPA-free plastic. It's still plastic, and it's still toxic. (All petrochemicals are toxic, and some are explosive like the synthetic Nitrogen named "ammonium nitrate").

Of those 80,000+ chemicals safety studies have been done on 200 of them. I don't have the list for them, but that's a very small number; too small to be a representative sample. It's safe to assume that none of them are safe. Explicitly none of the petrochemicals are safe for human and animal ingestion.

This is the background in which we in the US live. The further North, South and East one travels from Colorado, the worse it gets. Is it not coincidence that Colorado is one of the fittest states in the US. However, that will not last for long. The past 2 years have seen an increase in air pollution due to increase fracking. The frackers will say that fracking itself doesn't cause this pollution; they deliberately omit that it's the natural gasses that leak from these wells that's mucking up the air.

In short, we live in an extremely toxic environment. Petrochemicals infiltrate every single aspect of the US. You cannot go anywhere to escape exposure. In 1999, the EPA launched a Persistent Bioaccumulative and Toxic website that became inactive 3 years later. http://www.epa.gov/pbt/pubs/aboutpbt.htm  This is but one way that the severity of our toxic environment is withheld.

When I see a study that says "fill_in_the_blank" is safe I assume 2 things. 1) the study was done in such a way as to get the desired results. These studies are done deliberately to NOT mimic real world conditions. One way to do this: use unrealistic amounts of the chemical.  2) The studies rely on others research that use suspect methodology. I make these assumptions because only 200 of 80,000+ chemicals have ever been actually research with unbiased methods. And even then it's easily to lop off the sampling endpoints (omitting relevant data) to skew the results to have a "more studies needed" conclusion.

It's all deception in the name of greed. It will stop at nothing. This is the beast that devours. The scope, depth and breadth of the toxins in our land, water and air is beyond breathtaking.

In short, we're fucked. But the last chapter is yet to be written. It will not occur socially, per se. The social aspect has its genesis already. People have woken up to their divinity. Many are learning what their gift is, and how to use it best. We have passed the tipping point individually, but collectively that energy is yet to come.

So, how is this entry make it into Fruits of the Spirit? Easy: the original command holds true: be good stewards of the Earth. If you don't have your health, you don't have anything. Do I really have to say this? Yes I do. If you want the desired change for the positive to manifest sooner you need to start eat organic fruits and veggies and skip meat whenever possible.

Once you pass from this body it falls to our progeny to continue to be a part of the greatest awakening the world has ever seen so that we we inhabit a body again we will not live in perpetual fear perpetuated by manufactured wars that institutionalize greed.
