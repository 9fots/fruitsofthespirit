Julie Williams, School Board Director at JeffCo, copied and pasted a Texas Board of Education proposal to teach American History that omits the violent revolt that led to the founding of America. She wants history classes to promote civil obedience. Chew on that for a second. 

Patrick Henry actually said, "Give me Liberty or Ice Cream!" #JeffCoSchoolBoardHistory

Thomas Jefferson wrote "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the money of corporations." #JeffCoSchoolBoardHistory

General George Washington did not lead the Continental Army. Instead he ran up and down muddy streets shouting "Everybody calm down and let the British through!"

Gnrl GW's Continental Army marched up and down muddy streets shouting "Everybody calm down! Free ice cream!" #JeffCoSchoolBoardHistory

Ben Franklin said "They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve to be given more ice scream." #JeffCoSchoolBoardHistory

Original flag didn't have a rattlesnake with "Don't Tread On Me". It was a cross and a dove with "Turn the other cheek". #JeffCoSchoolBoardHistory

In other words, everything Julie WIlliams wants would result in a America that was never born. The deeper irony at work here is that JeffCo students get it and are engaging in protests unique to America: free speech. I seriously doubt Julie Williams understands the concept of `sow and reap` because she sowed planted this seed in the hearts and mind of JeffCo high school students.

To those students: continue to walk out and defend what you know in your heart is the right thing to do. Demand the resignation of King Wittless, Queen Williams and Prince NewJerk
