Once the physical is down it becomes a matter of mindfulness, breathing, facing immediate fears head on, and making one more move. Doesn't matter if it's toprope, leading, bouldering, ice, sport climbing. There's no better metric than seeing how you control your body-mind in the vertical outdoor elements.




You're being poisoned, made sick by food. It's lucrative business. The Colorado Dems position on 105 is
Carcin! Ogenic! We don't care! Everyone's got Obamacare!

The Colorado GOP's position is
Carcin! Ogenic! We don't care! Everyone's got private health care!

When I say our solutions are not political, I mean that you can't blame one party for problems. Both parties are different sides of the same coin of legalism. It's not smaller government you want, it's not bigger government you want. It's the liberty of self-governance that you want.

Both parties perpetuate their own brand of legalism. Conservatives adhere to an extremely thin, superficial ideology that I call the `Bare minimum`. They believe that in order to qualify for Heaven, all they have to do is the bare minimum. 

Liberals take the opposite approach: which I can `Bare Moderation`. It's a little bit more and better packaging than Conservatives. 

Killing? Legalized. Making people sick? Legalaized. Bomb American Farms with warfare chemicals? Legal. Destroy the very biosystem that supports all life on Earth? Legalized. The cure for EVERYTHING ailing the Earth, animals, and humans? Barely. The other side still believe that fear works. This November, prove them wrong. Vote Yes on #105
